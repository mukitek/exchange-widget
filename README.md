## Notes

I've implemented quite a few features. There are a few things I didn't implement because I didn't have time:

I didn't implement the cancel button. Could perhaps have made it clear the values
I didn't implement anything to stop an exchange if it exceeds the amount in the pocket.
I didn't implement code to insert commas in the values.

There are a few things I could have done differently:

Used a library for handling the money calculations
Used a library suchas redux-saga for the polling
Tidied up the css some more.
Added more tests.
Tested on other browsers - I only tested on chrome.
